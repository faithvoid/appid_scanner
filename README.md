# AppID Scanner
A tool for Linux users to scan their Steam compatdata/common folder and convert folder appIDs into human-parsable game names. 

## Todo:
- Modify code to also parse app IDs via PCGamingWiki for save data locations and automatically back up savegames found in those locations to a "saves" folder in the same folder as the script.
- Create a bare-basic UI for ease-of-use on Steam Deck using PyGUI.
